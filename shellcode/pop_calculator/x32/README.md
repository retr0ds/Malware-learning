### Assemble 

To compile the shellcode and get the object file we can use any assembler, I prefer `nasm`:
```bash
nasm -f win32 pop_calc_32.asm -o pop_calc_32.o
```

### Get Payload bytes

This is not necessary to just compile and run the shellcode. But, assuming we want to use this as payload, this is the onliner used to generate the instruction bytes

```bash
for i in $(objdump -D pop_calc_32.o | grep "^ " | cut -f2); do echo -n "\x$i" ; done
```


### Link
Before running this shellcode as such we would requrire linking, which can be done by
```bash
ld -m i386pe pop_calc_32.o -o pop_calc_32.exe
```
### To Run
```bash
pop_calc_32.exe
```
