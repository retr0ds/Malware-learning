# Payload

The payload I have chosen for this explanation is a simple "pop a calculator", which as the name suggests just launcher a calculator.

The assembly code for this shellcode can be found : [here](https://github.com/retr0ds/Malware-learning/tree/main/shellcode/pop_calculator)
The explanation behind the code's working can be found : [here](https://retr0ds.github.io/posts/shellcoding_series/series1_pop_a_calc_part_1/)
