# DLL Injection

DLL Injection is a technique that allows users to run any code in the memory of another process, by forcing the process to load a foreign DLL file.
In a nutshell, it is making a process forcibly run your code inside a dll, by attaching to the process on the fly without having to restart the process.
This is an inbuilt mechanism by design as even windows applictions make use of thiss technique to sometimes load dlls to certain processes.But this can be used 
for malicious intent when the process is left unchecked for such dll injections from other users/non-administrative users/without a proper access token.


In theory involves the following four steps:

* Attach to the process
* Allocate Memory within the process
* Copy the DLL or the DLL Path into the processes memory and determine appropriate memory addresses
* Instruct the process to execute your DLL

DLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory, then invoked with CreateRemoteThread (which calls the LoadLibrary API responsible for loading the DLL).

This allows for easy access intrusion and violation on windows systems. Usually defender is smart enough to identify a process that injects a dll into another process
and flags them as malicious, but if disguised properly using various obfuscation techniques and a proper encryption/packing algorithm, then it may be able to 
achieve malicious tasks through the process of DLL Injection.
