# About

This is a basic DLL that I wrote purely to showcase it by loading this as part of the DLL Injection code.
This just shows a [MessageBox](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-messagebox) to indicate that the DLL has indeed been loaded properly.

The message is called in the event of DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH.
