# DLL Injection 1
In this I have implemented DLL Injection based on PID, the program "DLLInjection.cpp" works by:
*  Taking in the process ID of the host process.
*  __OpenProcess__ API is used to open the process of given pid
*  __GetFullPathNameA__ gets the full path name of the DLL and stores it in given buffer array
*  __VirtualAllocEx__ takes in buffer length and process handle and creates memory space inside process region at the size of teh buffer
*  __WriteProcessMemory__ writes the buffer into memory allocated by the VirtualAlloc 
*  Then we use __GetModuleHandle__ to get handle to kernel32.dll and then using __GetProcAddress__ we get the address to LoadLibraryA
*  Finally using, __CreateRemoteThread__ we start a new thread which loads the procedure from the mentioned _dllPath_ and using the API at _LoadProcAddr_

The DLL itself does nothing but call a funciton within itself which opens a MessageBox with the message "Bruh" and caption "This is a caption".

It is to be noted that in this basic version of DLL Injection,

1)We need to manually provide the PID and the program is not suited for figuring out the PID based on the process name.

2)The DLL injection works only once per PID.
